Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP 
traffic log



The browser was not able to obtain the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com, which it needs to access the website because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port as indicated by the ICMP error message “udp port 53 unreachable.”
The DNS server is down or unreachable.



Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide one solution to implement
Today customers contacted the company that they could not reach the website.
PAcket sniffing tests were used to analyze the situation by the security team.
ICMS and UDP packets were analyzed with tcpdump. 
It was shown that the port 53 responsible for DNS service was not reachable.
The DNS server might be down due to the attack; or traffic was blocked by the firewall.
