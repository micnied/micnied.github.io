After tearing my Achilles tendon and few months, or more like few years, of a spiritual journey (which could be an idea for another separate blog post), I have finally decided to change my job and dedicate my time to cybersecurity.

I would like to write here what I have found so far after a full-on one month research on what to focus on, which certifications, websites, skills are the most useful and appreciated in the field of cybersecurity.

Here are essentials that you need to know, in my opinion. It all comes down to these 5 areas:

Policies, rules and regulations. As with any subject you need a bit of basic theory (triage, risk management, business continuity). Writing reports will be a big part of your job.
Networking. You need to know how the networks work (switches, routers etc), how they communicate, how you can build them and structure, so that after you are able to protect them (firewalls, VPNs).
Linux. Command line is indispensable in the field of security.
Programming. Mostly in Python and SQL. You will need the ability to code to search through databases and automate your work.
SIEM tools and other security applications. Last but not least! That will be your main part of the job, use the tools to detect and analyse threats and any suspicious behaviour in the systems, networks.
Valuable certifications to do: COMPTIA security+, CCNA, (ISC)2 CC, Google Cybersecurity.

There are many reviews about those certs on YouTube so you can go through them and decide which one suits you best.

Additional references that I found extremely helpful:

Network Chuck YouTube channel
David Bombal YouTube channel
Professor Messer website
FreeCodeCamp
Hope this helps, be aware that Iâ€™m just starting in cybersecurity as well so these are just my own opinions. More articles to come as I continue my learning path too.
